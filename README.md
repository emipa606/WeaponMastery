Adds a new simple weapon mastery mechanic into the game. Pawns use the same weapon for a decent amount of time, naturally they should start getting better at handling/using said weapon. This mod adds a new hidden skill that levels up as pawns use their weapons (similar to shooting/melee). Pawns will gradually receive some minor randomized bonuses from mastering weapons and will also rename their weapon for sentimental value.

#  More Description (Sorry, you can skip to features) 

You're probably asking at this point, how does this differ from vanilla melee/shooting skills? The pawn will only get stat bonuses when they equip one of their mastered weapons. Mastering a weapon can be done multiple times (multiple levels essentially) each time giving a new random stat bonus. The mod is highly configurable, you can add custom stats to the pools and customize the maximum number of levels and experience needed to reach each level.

#  Features 



 - Weapon Mastery (Minor stat boosts as weapon is being used)
 

  - Class weapon mastery system (Turned off by default)
  - Specific weapon mastery system
  

   - Pawns will name their weapons (Has a chance to occur when gaining the first mastery level)
   - Mood buff for equipping a mastered weapon and a debuff for losing one (Turned off by default)
  

  - Pawns generated from events (raids, traders or visitors) will spawn with weapon masteries
  - Bonded weapons level faster
  - Relic weapons give flat additional bonus to ideology believers
 

 - Highly Configurable



#  A note about class mastery 

The class system is disabled by default because it requires you to assign a class to each modded weapon either through the config menu or writing a patch. The game doesn't know that a modded assault rifle and a vanilla assault rifle are both of the class assault rifle, you have to tell it that. You won't gain any class experience if you're using a weapon with an unknown class. I've already patched vanilla weapons and some of my favorite mods. If you'd like to write a patch so you could share it with everyone, take a look at the mod's patches folder. It should be extremely easy to write for your favorite mods.

#  Where to find masteries? 

There's currently no way to view mastery stats attained except by looking at the weapon's main description window for the specific mastery system and the pawn's info tab for class mastery system.
