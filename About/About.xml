    v2.0.4

    Adds a new simple weapon mastery mechanic into the game. Pawns use the same weapon for a decent amount of time, naturally they should start getting better at handling/using said weapon. This mod adds a new hidden skill that levels up as pawns use their weapons (similar to shooting/melee). Pawns will gradually receive some minor randomized bonuses from mastering weapons and will also rename their weapon for sentimental value.</description>
